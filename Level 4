function escape(input) {
    // make sure the script belongs to own site
    // sample script: http://prompt.ml/js/test.js
    if (/^(?:https?:)?\/\/prompt\.ml\//i.test(decodeURIComponent(input))) {
        var script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = input;
        return script.outerHTML;
    } else {
        return 'Invalid resource.';
    }
} 


Solution:-  if you look on line number 4 then it's saying "Script belongs to own site" and just under this line a sample script is given.
It means we have to use this code or can upload the own html script. Because of not having option of uploading anything we can use the same script for payload.


Ans:           http://prompt.ml/js/test.js                     //After using this paload you will get something like "test.js is loaded" that means you have cleared this level.
